# About This Song

[Full Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r9PWKnZeIs&list=PLki6_zDbt48bnx5eKbuRPT7vERa6BC0sk)

For this performance, I played bass on **"満ちていく体温 (Michiteiku Taion)"** by Blu-Swing, **"EVERBLUE"**
 by Omoinotake, **"Plastic Love"** by Mariya Takeuchi, **"From The Start"** by Laufey, **"四季ノ唄 (Shiki no Uta)"**
  by MINMI, **"パステルレイン (Pastel Rain)"** by Sangatsu no Phantasia, **"LOST IN PARADISE"** by ALI, and
  **"Just The Two of Us"** by Grover Washington. I also sang for **"Leave The Door Open"** by Silk Sonic.

This technically wasn't a live performance we did, but rather a recording session to get nice sounding
versions of our our renditions of the songs we covered. This was the last time I ever played with
GenKEY at all. The random choice I made to join GenKEY even though I knew next to nothing about playing
music was arguably the best deciscion I made in all of college. I grew so much and met so many cool people
and had so many unforgettable experiences. I truly wouldn't trade having been in this band for anything.

[Full Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-a-iWsblf8&list=PLki6_zDbt48an3hJOyam_wJSFuWlUoUpn)

For this performance, I played bass on **"Cool Down"** by Kolohe Kai, "Higher Than the Clouds" by Anuhea,
**"Love Me"** by Fia, **"Fly Away"** by Fia, **"Let's Do It Again"** by J Boog and **"Santeria"** by Sublime.

This performance was a little different as we were asked by the Hawaiian Culture Club to play a reggae set,
which was very different from what we normally did. The day was very cold so the shorts you see me wearing are 
are something I very much regretted. But, the food. **THE FOOD.** That was some of the best food I ate during
my entire college experience. Made all the work and cold worth it.

For this performmance, I played bass on **"パステルレイン (Pastel Rain)"** by Sangatsu no Phantasia, 
**"Plastic Love"** by Mariya Takeuchi, **"LOST IN PARADISE"** by ALI, and **"ドライフラワー (Dried Flower)"**
by Yuuri. I also sang for **"Leave The Door Open"** by Silk Sonic.

This was my last official performance with Tsukimi GenKEY. I put my all into singing a song far above my skill
level (there's only one Bruno Mars, after all) and ended my time with a bang. "Pastel Rain" was also one of
the more fun songs I got to learn and I'm sad it just got one performance. The last song we played,
"Dried Flower", was a collection of all the people from the band who were about to graduate, so
I got to play with one of my old bandmates that had left the band for about a year. I feel bad because
I feel I did not do him justice while I was on bass.

For this performance, I played bass on **"Plastic Love"** by Mariya Takeuchi. I also sang for **"See 
You Again"** by Tyler, the Creator.

Echoing what I said in the post before this about confidence while singing in front of a crowd,
except this time I fully in a public space instead of at an event with people I knew. This is one of
the first time I remember debating with myself about how high I would try to sing the song until
the moment I actually had to do it, at which I decided to go an octave lower than usual
for the sake of consistency and control.

For this performance, I played bass on **"満ちていく体温 (Michiteiku Taion)"** by Blu-Swing, **"Plastic Love"** by
Mariya Takeuchi, and **"EVERBLUE"** by Omoinotake. I also sang for **"See You Again"** by Tyler, the Creator.

This is another turning point in my music journey because instead of playing keys or bass in the background,
this was the first time I sang in front of a crowd. It is also unfortunate that the first recorded instance
of me singing on the internet starts with a voice crack, but I digress. Of all the roles in a band,
I genuinely believe that singing is the hardest to perform with because any nerves you feel come out in your
voice and make you even more nervous, which starts a negative feedback look. That stagefright confidence that
I had been riding on since my first performance with GenKEY was failing me. But at some point, I came to the 
realization that no good performer was non-chalant, so I commited to the bit. I became the white boy putting everything
he had into rapping a Tyler, the Creator song.

[Full Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uevpoa95G7Y&list=PLki6_zDbt48ZILfVGzPWon59isDvq-i92)

For this performance, I played bass on **"満ちていく体温 (Michiteiku Taion)"** by Blu-Swing, **"nouvelle vague"**
by wave to earth, **"After The Storm"** by Kali Uchis, **"EVERBLUE"** by Omoinotake, **"Plastic Love"** by
Mariya Takeuchi, **"四季ノ唄 (Shiki no Uta)"** by MINMI, and **"LOST IN PARADISE"** by ALI.

This was my first performance with Tsukimi GenKEY after swapping "bands". I felt like my role on bass was a lot
more interesting with the kind of music they were playing, on top of generally feeling more attracted towards
this kind of music, so I was very happy with the swap. At this point, I was still pretty weak instrumentally
and was commiting the pre-existing basslines to muscle memory, but everyone else in the band was very
talented when it came to improvising. This performance was a little different because our vocalist couldn't
make it, so without the lyrics we ended up getting lost a few times, and after a while we gave up on playing
the songs how we normally would and just kept improvising for fun. I tried to keep up as much as I could,
and this moment is the reason why, to this day, I am so interested in learning jazz improvization on keys and bass.

For this performance, I played bass on **"星が泳ぐ (Hoshi ga Oyogu)"** by Macaroni Empitsu, **"新宝島 (Shin Takarajima)"**
by Sakanaction, **"Black Sheep"** by Metric, **グッドバイ(Goodbye)** by Sakanaction, and **"さよならはエモーション 
(Sayonara wa Emotion)"** by Sakanaction.

"Hoshi ga Oyogu" was one of the harder songs I learned for GenKEY, especially since this was the first song
I needed to learn in a key different from its original which meant I couldn't listen to the original for reference
like I had been for every other song thus far. It's a little tragic we just played it this one time.

For this performance, I played bass on Good Kid's **"From The Start"**, **"Tek It"** by Cafuné, **"告白直前酸欠状態 (Choked Up To
Ask You Out)"** by Yuuri, **"ないものねだり (Naimononedari)"** by Kana-Boon, **"Freaks"** by Surf Curse and Travis Barker,
**"さよならはエモーション (Sayonara wa Emotion)"** by Sakanaction, and Good Kid's **"From The Start"**.

This was one of the most fun performances I had with GenKEY. This was our largest setlist at the time,
and the only time I can remember that we played an encore we didn't prepare in advance, which is why the last song or two might
sound a little shaky.

to be on that stage with GenKEY myself.

For this performance I played bass on **"告白直前酸欠状態 (Choked Up ToAsk You Out)"** by Yuuri,
 **"行って (Itte)"** by Yorushika, and **"さよならはエモーション (Sayonara wa Emotion)"** by Sakanaction.

This performance was a big pivot for me. Our band needed a bassist, and as at the time I had been sharing the keys
role with someone else, I wanted to play something that would allow me to play more songs. So I started learning
bass from scratch, recruited a good friend of mine to start playing keys since (ironically) we ended up without
a keyboard player at all once I went to bass, and made the official swap to bass for the next year and a half.

For this performance, I played keys on **"行って (Itte)"** by Yorushika and Good Kid's **"From The Start".**

This performance stands out to me because of songs I was not actually a part of. At this point, I was a
part of Hanami GenKEY, which was the part of our band that played J-Rock and some western rock. The other half
of the performance was Tsukimi GenKEY, which was more on the jazzy and funky side of Japanese music, with some
dips into korean and western music when it felt tonally aligned. That was the first time I had ever heard them
perform, and there was something about the song choices and their performance that really grabbed my attention,
to the point where I forgot about the formal we were playing for entirely. This was an inflection point for
my music career because my next goal was to start playing with them once the opportunity arose.

[Full Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXY7t0yvLKc&list=PLki6_zDbt48b5brr86CrMvqzYfic3dMvg)

This was my first performance with my band, Hanami GenKEY. I play keys for three of the songs we performed for this set,
being **"行って (Itte)"** by Yorushika, a cover of Good Kid's cover of Laufey's **"From The Start"**,
and **"ないものねだり (Naimononedari)"** by Kana-Boon.

For this performance, since I had really just started trying to play music from practically scratch,
all I was doing was playing the basic chord progressions with my right hand. It's crazy to me how much
more I can do now, but even if what I was doing back then was simple, I was still up there doing my job.
Speaking of being up there, what shocked me the most about this performance was how few nerves I felt.
I grew up really shy and having really strong stage fright, so the fact that I was performing for a crowd
and having fun was really surprising to me. That feeling is what made me feel like joining GenKEY was
one of the best choices I've ever made.
